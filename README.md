# Switch SDL2 Test
just another Switch SDL Test.

Based on https://github.com/ckarcz/switch-sdl2-example .   
But somethings have changed in SDL2 so the libs needed to be corrected.

After I fixed the Libs in the Makefile.  
I added a audio track like shown in the Switch examples.

and added a extra texture in to the screen.

Need to learn much more about programming but I getting there LoL.

Hope You Enjoy!
